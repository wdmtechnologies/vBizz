Pending Intent        :  A PendingIntent is a token that you give to a foreign application (e.g. NotificationManager, AlarmManager,
                         Home Screen AppWidgetManager, or other 3rd party applications), which allows the foreign application to use your
                         application's permissions to execute a predefined piece of code.
                         If you give the foreign application an Intent, it will execute your Intent with its own permissions.
                         But if you give the foreign application a PendingIntent, that application will execute your Intent using your
                         application's permission
                         A PendingIntent specifies an action to take in the future. It lets you pass a future Intent to another
                         application and allow that application to execute that Intent as if it had the same permissions as your
                         application, whether or not your application is still around when the Intent is eventually invoked

                         It is an Intent action that you want to perform but at a later time.
                         The reason it’s needed is because an Intent must be created and launched from a valid Context in your application,
                         but there ar   e certain cases where one is not available at the time you want to run the action because you are
                         technically outside the application’s context (the two common examples are launching an Activity from a
                         Notification or a BroadcastReceiver.By creating a PendingIntent you want to use to launch, say, an Activity
                         while you have the Context to do so (from inside another Activity or Service)


                     It's a token that your app process will give to the location process, and the location process will use it to wake up your app when
                     an event of interest happens. So this basically means that your app in the background doesn't have to be always running.
                        When something of interest happens, we will wake you up. This saves a lot of battery.
